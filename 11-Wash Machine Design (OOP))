# Requirement: Wash Machine

# 1. Define the class of "Wash Machine"
class WashMachine(): # Upper Camel Case is needed
    def wash(self):
        print("do the laundry")
        print(self) # self = object_WM
    # Obtain the attributes of the objects //From the inside//
    def print_info(self):
        print(f"The width of the wash machine is {self.width}")
        print(f"The height of the wash machine is {self.height}")


# 2. Construct the objects
object_WM = WashMachine()
object_WM2 = WashMachine()
## 2.1 Add the attributes to the objects
object_WM.width = 400
object_WM.height = 500
## 2.2 The inside attributes transfering(self.attribute)
object_WM.print_info()


# 3. Check the outcome
# 3.1 Print "object_WM"
print(object_WM)
print(object_WM2)
# 3.2 Use "wash()" --- Object Method: Object.wash()
object_WM.wash()
object_WM2.wash() # Different objects (self) will have different addresses
# 3.3 Obtain the attributes of the objects //From the outside//
print(f"The width of the wash machine is {object_WM.width}")
print(f"The height of the wash machine is {object_WM.height}")
